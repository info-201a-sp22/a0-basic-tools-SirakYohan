## Data Viz Summary.
 
Essentially, the image is supposed to create a visual between technology long ago,
compared to technology now. The paragraph before explains the iphone xr now
currently can perform more than 140 million more instructions per second than a
standard IBM System/360. In order to create a visual, the author decides to create
a visual for the reader. The y axis compares the log2 of the number of components
per integrated function and the year as the x axis. As you can see, from 1959 to
1975, you can see a steady increase in log2 of the number of components per
integrated function as the years progress. 
 
The quote from the book that relates to graph
 
>  "We now have computers in the form of phones that fit in our pockets and—in the case of the 2019 Apple iPhone XR—can perform more than 140 million more instructions per second than a standard IBM System/360. That rate of change is astounding; it represents an exponential growth in computing capacity (figure 0.2a)."

## Data Viz Biography.
 
1. **Who or what institution produced the visualization?**
    The paper that produced the visualization was moores law.
2. **When was it produced?**
    in 1965
3. **Who is the audience for the visualization? Who might be impacted, either directly or indirectly, by the visualization?**
    The whole world since it talked about how much technology you can fit in a circuit
4. __What values, goals, or interests are at stake with the visualization?__
    I feel like the goals and values of the visualization definetly aligned with the statement the author was trying to make about (technology from past to present).
5. **What can be learned from the visualization?**
    That technology over time has improved greatly
6. **What issues, if any, related to power and justice are reflected in the data
 visualization?**
    Issues that technology progression may take over other peoples jobs. Automation is an example of the evolution of technology.
